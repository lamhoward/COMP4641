## pa1_linearRegr.ipynb

Linear Regressions of the three data sets are performed in this file. It also computes the R<sup>2</sup> scores and plots the distribution histogram of the squared errors.

## pa1\_logRegr\_learningRate.ipynb

Learning rates of logistic regressions are munaully found in this file.

## pa1_logRegr.ipynb

Logistic Regressions of the three data sets are performed in this file. It also computes the accuracy and plots the AUC curves and the confusion matrices.

## pa1\_neural_crossValidation.ipynb

Cross validations of neural networks are done in this file. It explots the built-in module of sklearn named **GridSearchCV** and does 5-fold cross validations.

## pa1_neural.ipynb

Single-hidden-layer Neural Networks of the three data sets are performed in this file. It also computes the accuracy and plots the confusion matrices.
